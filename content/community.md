# Community

The most important aspect of binrw is not macro magic, or parsing, or whatever. It's smart, talented, kind, and understanding people choosing to spend time talking about a silly parsing framework.

Need help? Have ideas? Questions about contributing? Just like talking about Rust? Feel free to join our chat:

* [Discord](https://discord.gg/ABy4Qh549j)
* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#binrw:matrix.org)

Prefer one over the other? No worries! The discord and matrix channels are bridged together, so you can feel at-home regardless of whichever fits. No matter your experience level, we'd love to have you. Please don't be afraid to ask for help, nobody was born an expert and we've cultivated a small community of people who will meet you where you're at. The worst that can happen is that people are busy and can't answer.

Have any binrw community issues? Message @jam1garner on either platform (or twitter). Intolerance will not be tolerated. If your issue is just that I forgot to give you the "Contributor" role, please message me about that too! It's there for a reason, no matter how small a contribution!

# Showcase

Want to have your work shown off? Post about it in the binrw chat, and maybe you'll be included below!
